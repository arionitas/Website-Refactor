# Website-Refactor

## Deployed Project

https://arionitas.github.io/Website-Refactor/

## Description


My motivation for this project is my music and my family. I want to learn to build projects because my sister is about to give birth and I would like to make a website for her kid when they are born, with memories of our lives and a bunch of cool things as they grow.

Alongside this, I also want to develop my own website along with helping others create pages for themselves eventually. (As soon as I am good enough to lend a hand as others before me have helped me)

So far there are a few problems I am trying to solve i.e The most current problem I am running into is the verified pages section, it is currently empty for me and hopefully I can solve this.

Learning that coding is as painstakingly hard as you want it to be lol Plus I am unemployed right now so it is mentally draining not being accepted anywhere by anyone regardless of the skillset I have built over the years as a creative director. Sad, super Sad Times. Learning my limitations, breaking my limitations, learning that I am weak, I can break and I can rebuild myself too. (Eventually)
